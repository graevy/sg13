YEAR 2 PLOT SUMMARY - PLAYER PERSPECTIVE

Session 1

Hartman and Met'uu (officially on shore leave, but moonlighting in the Pegasus galaxy) return to Earth via a stolen ZPM.
Their task for the Trust (to swap a dead ZPM for a live one, gate to Pegasus, and send a message to an unspecified 8-chevron address) was a success.
Hartman saved a copy of the message+address, and brought it to Dr. Lee for analysis.
Lee noted that the message seemed to interfere with gate dialing protocols in order to connect an 8th chevron address to a gate within the same galaxy.
Requiring a ZPM to draw the power, the overpowered wormhole overloads gate capacitors, causing the receiving gate to reach a supercritical temperature and ultimately undergo fission.
