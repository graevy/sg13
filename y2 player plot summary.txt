YEAR 2 PLOT SUMMARY - PLAYER PERSPECTIVE

#############################
#############################

Session 1

Hartman and Met'uu (officially on shore leave, but moonlighting in the Pegasus galaxy) return to Earth via a stolen ZPM.
Their task for the Trust (to swap a dead ZPM for a live one, gate to Pegasus, and send a message to an unspecified 8-chevron address) was a success.
Hartman saved a copy of the message+address, and brought it to Dr. Lee for analysis.
Lee noted that the message seemed to interfere with gate dialing protocols in order to connect an 8th chevron address to a gate within the same galaxy.
Requiring a ZPM to draw the power, the overpowered wormhole overloads gate capacitors, causing the receiving gate to reach a supercritical temperature and ultimately undergo fission.

Sessions 2&3

SG13 gets ordered to stealth proxy-jump (using a cloaked jumper behind someone else going through a gate) to Nassya.
They piggybacked onto a wormhole heading to a former Goa'uld occupied world which had a small weather-detection outpost.
The Lucien alliance was in orbit in a cloaked tel'tak and proceeded to investigate the outpost after SG13 tripped some detection.
SG13 was gone by the time they arrived, so the encounter (2 lucien thugs with zats) was avoided.
On the planet, SG13 encountered another Trust makeshift base of operations. There were 10 people (1 leader) and an ashrak.
After successfully obtaining the computers used in their operations, SG13 gated immediately back to the SGC without reviewing the intel.
Hartman got hit by 2 zat shots, and needed critical care on Atlantis.
Dr. Lee has gone missing since then.
